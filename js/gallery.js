To slow the pedestrians down we implemented stacks of neon yellow pallets placed strategically around the plaza to gain attention and to give them a place to sit. We then gathered information in the form of a questionnaire from individuals that passed through to find a more permanent solution on how to activate the space.<br> <b>Team:</b><em> Sarah Maas, Danny Horrigan, Cory Brown + Dominic Muttel</em>',
